# Interfaces layer

Stores the code related to the user interface layer's interaction with the front-end application, data conversion and interaction. Front-end applications use the interfaces in this layer to get the data needed for front-end presentation from application services. Takes care of RESTful requests sent by the front-end user, parses the configuration file entered by the user, and passes the data to the application layer. The code for data assembly, data transfer format conversion, and facade interface encapsulation will be placed in this layer of the catalogue.
